This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)-based application.

NextJS was used because I (Nathan) am a frontend developer by trade, and this is the API tool I have been most familiar with over the last few years. It can quite work well as a part of a full-stack JS application, typically as a backend-for-frontend api. Though admittedly it wouldn't be everyone's first choice as a dedicated microservice node-based api.
